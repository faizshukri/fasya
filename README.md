# Fasya.Com

Fasya.Com is my wedding site portal. Developed using AngularJS as main platform.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies.
    
    ```bash
    # Install if you didn't have compass yet
    gem install compass

    # Install if you didn't have grunt-cli yet
    npm install -g grunt-cli

    # Install local packages
    npm install

    # Install assets
    bower install
    ```

2. Build the project.

    ```bash
    # For development
    grunt serve

    # For production

    ```

    If you build using `grunt serve`, you can navigate to `http://localhost:9000` directly to view the site.
